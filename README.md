# FoxelFramework
The Foxel Framework is a framework that is meant to wrap around OpenGL functions to provide efficiency, and is also by itself a library.

Foxel works well when its source code is used with the the project your working on, allowing you to fix some functions to your own adjustment, or making functions that may need to be implemented. Foxel is really meant to be used with its source code, but if you prefer using it as a library that's also a option.

Foxel also does provide a template for an example window, but you don't have to use it if you don't want to.
